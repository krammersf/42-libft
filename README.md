Library to 42's school

This is the code for the libft library, a collection of custom-written C functions commonly used in various projects. The library includes functions for string manipulation, memory allocation, and linked list management, among others.

The code is divided into three parts: Part 1, Part 2, and Bonus. Part 1 and Part 2 contain functions that are mandatory for the project, while the Bonus part includes both linked functions and the mandatory ones.

## Instructions
To compile the code, run `make` in the terminal. This will create a library called `libft.a`.

To compile the bonus functions, run `make bonus`. This will add the bonus functions to the library.

The Makefile must not relink.

To clean the object files and library, run `make clean` and `make fclean`, respectively.

To clean and compile again, run `make re` and `make rebonus`, respectively.

The library is accompanied by a header file called libft.h, which contains prototypes for all the functions in the library. To use the library in your project, include the header file and link to the library as described above.
